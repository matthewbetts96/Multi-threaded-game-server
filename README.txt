Created as part of a Concurrency Coursework.

How to run:

Compile all with javac *.java 

Run Server.java with a port number as args[0] (eg java Server 1234)

Run Client on localhost with the same port number (eg java Client localhost 1234)

Do this for the other client(s)

Remember that each process must be on it's own command line.

This program will however only work with 2 clients playing the game.
